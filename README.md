__Instagram part of the code isn't working anymore; I wrote a new program just for Instagram, it's called [InstaBurst](https://github.com/Ethical-H4CK3R/InstaBurst).__

# hyprPulse

hyprPulse, an interactive brute force tool that can simultaneously attack multiple accounts, from multiple sites, using multiple wordlists; all while staying anonymous.

### Requirements
  - Kali Linux 2.0
  - Python V2.7

### Installation
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Ethical-H4CK3R/hyprPulse
$ cd hyprPulse
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

Start the program
```sh
$ python pulsar.py
```
